## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface BugForm {
  title: string
  description: string
  steps: string
  expected: string
  actual: string
  browser: string
  email: string
}

interface FeatureForm {
  title: string
  description: string
  useCase: string
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  email: string
}
```

### Navigation Integration
- Added Help tab to main navigation (7th tab)
- Uses Question icon from Phosphor Icons
- Responsive design maintains mobile compatibility

### State Management
- `activeSection`: Controls which help section is displayed
- `expandedFaq`: Tracks which FAQ item is expanded
- `bugReportDialog` / `featureRequestDialog`: Control modal visibility
- Form state management for bug reports and feature requests

### Data Handling
Currently logs submissions to console. In production, these would be sent to:
- Bug tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues)
- Feature request management system
- Email notification system
- Customer support platform

## Design Principles

### Accessibility
- Proper form labels and structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly icons and text
- Color contrast compliance

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure (expandable FAQ)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Contextual help and guidance
- Non-intrusive form validation

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing GradeFlow design system
- Color-coded sections (blue for setup, red for bugs, yellow for features)
- Icon-based navigation and identification
- Card-based layout for easy scanning

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Search functionality** in FAQ section
2. **Categorized FAQ** with filtering
3. **Video tutorials** embedded in setup guide
4. **Progress tracking** for setup completion
5. **Live chat integration** for immediate support
6. **Knowledge base integration** with external help docs
7. **Screenshot upload** for bug reports
8. **Voting system** for feature requests

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Analytics tracking** for help usage patterns
2. **A/B testing** different help content approaches
3. **Feedback system** for help content quality
4. **Integration with support ticket system**
5. **User onboarding flow** that references help content

## Usage Instructions

   - **Setup Guide**: If you're new to GradeFlow
   - **FAQ**: For quick answers to common questions
   - **Report Bug**: If something isn't working correctly
   - **Feature Request**: To suggest improvements

### For Developers
- Bug reports and feature requests are currently logged to console
- Implement actual submission endpoints in production
- Consider adding form validation libraries for enhanced UX
- Monitor help section usage analytics to improve content

## Deployment Notes
